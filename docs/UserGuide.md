## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. What is Gim?

Gim is a desktop app for **managing and tracking gym exercises**, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are an avid Vim user and can type fast, then look no further because Gim commands are inspired by those of Vim. Not only can Gim help you **keep track of your workouts and personal records**, Gim can also help you to **craft a workout** based on your personal records!

### 1.2. Who is this guide for?
Are you a gym-goer looking to use Gim to track your exercises? This user guide will get you started in no time and help you navigate through Gim's features. For a quick start guide, head over to [Getting Started](#3-getting-started).

## 3. Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `gim.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Gim.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the one shown below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   <br>![Ui](images/Ui.png)


5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`:help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 4. GUI Orientation

![GUI](images/GUIOrientation.png)

### 4.1. Command Box

The `Command Box` is where you can input your commands.

### 4.2. Exercise List

The `Exercise List Window` displays the latest exercise you entered at the bottom of the list by default. All exercises added will be displayed in the list. The list may change or reorder depending on the command issued by you.

### 4.3. Result Display

The `Result Display Window` displays feedback after executing a command. This includes feedback for both feedback for correctly and incorrectly entered commands.

### 4.4. Recognised Exercise Name List

The `Recognised Exercise Name List Window` provides you a list of all unique exercise names that are currently registered in the system.
<br><br>This list updates in real time and allows you to keep track of the exercises you have input in the past. As such, you are able to keep track of what you named your exercises; you would also be able to quickly identify any misspellings in the name of your inputted exercises.

![RecognisedList](images/RecognisedExercisesOrientation.png)

* The `Recognised Exercises Count` displays the number of unique exercises registered in the system.
* The `System Exercise Entries Count` displays the total number of exercise entries in the system.
<br>

**Adding and Deleting from the Exercise Name List**

The `Recognised Exercise Name List Window` is generated based on the exercise entries in the system. Hence, the Recognised Exercise Name List is automatically updated whenever you add or delete an entry from the system.

<div id="names" markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**<br>
Exercise names are recognised as equal if, upon removing white spaces and setting the names to lowercase, the names are the same.<br><br>
i.e. "Bench Press", "BENCH PRESS", "BenchPress" will be logged as the same exercise for your convenience in adding.<br><br>
However, the first time you add an exercise with an unrecognised name, the Recognised Exercise Name List will save the form you have input. Choose wisely!
</div>

## 5. Commands

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `n/NAME w/WEIGHT`, `NAME` and `WEIGHT` are parameters which can be used as `n/Squat w/100`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [d/DATE]` can be used as `n/Deadlift d/27-10-22` or as `n/Deadlift`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[n/NAME]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `n/Squat` (i.e. 1 time), `n/Squat n/Deadlift` (i.e. 2 times) etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME w/WEIGHT`, `w/WEIGHT n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `n/Squat n/Deadlift`, only `n/Deadlift` will be taken.

* Redundant inputs for commands that do not take in additional parameters (such as `:list`, `:sort`, `:help` `:wq`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `:help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Tips and Tricks

Tip 1: Gim's `range` and `filter` commands operate on the current exercise list, hence you can use the commands successively to narrow the lists down to what you want to find. For instance, you can keep track of your exercise progression over a period of time through the use of `:filter NAME` followed by a `range last/NUMBER_OF_DAYS`.

Example: If you  want to view your squat progression over the past week, you should input these three commands successively:
* `:list` Current exercise list now shows all exercises.
* `:filter Squat` Current exercise list now shows 'Squat' exercises.
* `:range last/7`  Current exercise list now shows 'Squat' exercises in the past 7 days.

Tip 2: Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing the data file in
<br>
`[JAR file location]/data/exercisetracker.json`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Gim will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 7. FAQ

**Q**: When should I use the `:list` command?
<br>
**A**: The `:list` command resets the display of the exercise list, displaying all the exercise entries in the system (in the order the entries were input in the system). This can be used after commands, such as `:filter` or `:range` are used to change the display list.

**Q**: Can I change the name of my uniquely registered exercise?
<br>
**A**: To change the way it is represented, you can find the exercise with the name, delete the entries and re-enter the exercises with your new name of choice.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: The way you format the exercise name when you first add it will be the way it is displayed in the system. After that, all exercises added that have the <a href="#names">same name</a> will be categorised under the same exercise.**<br>

</div>

**Q**: Can I edit an exercise?
<br>
**A**: You can do so by deleting the entry and adding a new entry.

**Q**: Why is `:filter` not showing the "correct" list even though I have input a valid exercise name?
<br>
**A**: `:filter` works on the displayed list shown in the Exercise List Window. If your displayed list is empty or has been altered by list changing commands such as `:range` or `:filter`, the `:filter` command will not filter from the original full list.
<br><br>
If you would like to filter from the original full list instead, try executing the command `:list` to display the full list before running `:filter` again.
